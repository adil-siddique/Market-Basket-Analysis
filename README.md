# Market-Basket-Analysis

We have a groceries dataset and we are going to analyze it, to give better recommendation to the customers. This will help stores understand which items are most frequently purchaced and capitalize on that knowledge.

1. They can do this by recommending customers to purchase certain items together. This will help ease the customer purchase decisions.
2. Offer certain discounts on basket of goods. This will ultimately lead them to generate more revenue through sales volume.
3. Increased sales volume means faster moving inventory. This will reduce the inventory holding cost and ultimately leading to more profits.
